Watcher Client is a cross-platform desktop application built with Fyne that connects to the Watcher Backend to manage website monitors.
Each installation acts as its own instance, automatically registering with the backend and allowing the user to create, edit, and delete monitors.

The client provides:
	•	A desktop UI for adding URLs, CSS selectors, frequencies, and email notification settings
	•	A list of active monitors retrieved from the backend
	•	A history view showing all detected changes
	•	A detail window that displays HTML text diffs
	•	Automatic instance registration and configuration storage

Designed to work with a shared backend, the client is a lightweight control panel for tracking website changes from any device.
